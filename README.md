This repository contains the dataset for paper: PatDDR:Data-Driven Decomposed Representations for Patent Relevance Assessment.

# Abstract
Patent relevance assessment, a fundamental component to rank candidates for prior art candidate search, calculates technical similarity based on patent text. However, current works exist two shortages. The first one is ignoring the potential technical relevance in the metadata information, such as the fields of classification, inventor, applicant. The second one is the predictive bias originated from the potential confounding relation. This paper proposes a patent-oriented data-driven decomposed representation model (PatD$^2$DR) for patent relevance assessment, which contains observed variables, confounding variables, treatment variables, adjustment variables and output variables. The characteristics of PatD$^2$DR lie in the followings: (1) it fuses the metadata information in a structural causal model to calculate technical similarity. (2) it decomposes confounding representations and adjustment representations through a data-driven method. The former fuses the potential technical relevance while the latter resolves the predictive bias. We evaluates the effectiveness of PatD$^2$DR on CLEF-IP 2011. Experimental results demonstrates that PatD$^2$DR effectively fuses the metadata information and reduces the predictive bias, and obtains the state-of-the-art ranking performance.
